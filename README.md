#End-to-End Data Analytics Project using Python and SQL
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics process. We use the Kaggle API to download datasets, clean and process the data with Pandas, and then load it into a SQL Server for advanced querying. The project includes a set of SQL queries to answer key questions about the data.

Key Features
Download data using Kaggle API.
Perform data cleaning and processing with Pandas.
Load cleaned data into a SQL Server.
Analyze the data by running complex SQL queries.
Technologies Used
Python: Data analysis and processing (Pandas, SQLAlchemy).
SQL: Data storage and querying.
Kaggle API: Dataset download.
Pandas: Data cleaning and manipulation.
SQLAlchemy: Database connection and interaction.
Jupyter Notebook (optional): Code execution and analysis.
